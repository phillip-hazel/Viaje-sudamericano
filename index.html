            A trip to South America: not eat, pray, love.
        </h1>
        <p>A borderline too short period of time after the start of our relationship, Julia and I decided that after graduating from college we would take a trip down to South America. Find photos and first person accounts from our voyages below.</p>
        <h2>Paso 1: Santiago, Chile</h2>

        <p>Julia and I departed from Charlotte, NC on the 12th of September, and after about 12 total hours of flight time found ourselves <i>aterrizados</i> in Santiago. Pastora, a Chilean friend a Julia's that attended her high school had previously agreed to host us in the city for a few days before we continued onwards to Valparaiso. We landed at about 7am, and faced a slight conundrum. Santiago, we knew, was a reasonably safe place in terms of violent crime, but we also knew that petty theft was commonplace. We 1. didn't know the safest mode of transport from the aiport (a quick google search revealed that official city taxis were great, though pricey), and, given the early hour, we had no response from Pastora on whether or not we could arrive at her house yet. We didn't much care for the idea of wandering the unfamiliar city with all of our possessions the we had brought for the next three months. We eventually on going to a cafe near Pastora's house, but shortly after beginning the taxi ride, Pastora let us know that we could go to her house. It was about a 40 minute trip through the city, and the taxi driver was friendly and gave us some good Spanish-speaking confidence.</p>
        <p>The welcome that we received from Pastora and her mother couldn't have been kinder. Psatora had prepared warm bread with mermelada, ham and cheese for toppings. When Marciela, the mother, came downstairs from her room, we embraced Julia and me and kissed us both on the cheek, having never met us. They waxed poetic about the exchange program that brought Julia and Pastora together in the first place. Before leaving for work, Marciela made sure to tell us to enjoy the city, but also to be careful and keep our wits about us and our phones in our pockets. Pastora seemed quite ready to show us the city, but while she took a shower Julia and I laid our heads down on our very cozy twin bed and realized that we needed a little more of a break before hitting the road.</p>
        <p>After an insane nap and a grumpy wakeup, we were off through the city. We stopped by a few museums and famous plazas, and learned a little bit about the history of the country, especially with regard to the dictatorship under Augustin Pinochet. Pastora had family with troubles under his oppresive rule, and with our newfound knowledge, still-open wounds from the dictatorship became apparent walking the streets of the city in poverty, angry graffiti, tired faces and signs asking still about <i>los desaparecidos.</i></p>
